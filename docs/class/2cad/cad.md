<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">What Is AutoCAD?</span></h1>
<br>

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial) is a computer-aided design software developed by the company Autodesk (hence the name AutoCAD). It allows you to draw and edit digital 2D and 3D designs more quickly and easily than you could by hand.

<br><h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">History</span></h1>
<br>

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial) first became notable because it was the first [CAD](https://all3dp.com/2/what-is-cad-software/) program developed for PC use (instead of industrial computers) in the 1980s. With computer hardware becoming more capable, the company behind AutoCAD, Autodesk, wanted to make CAD accessible to more people. 
<br><br>
AutoCAD has remained the dominant program in many design industries because it’s continuously updated. There’s a new version released every year, and new features are always being added.

<br><h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">Characteristics</span></h1>
<br>AutoCAD’s core competency is 2D design. Its workspace is basically a drafting desk on your computer, and this hasn’t changed since its introduction.

<br><br>

At the same time, [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial) has kept up with the times. When 3D computer-aided design became popular, AutoCAD integrated corresponding capabilities to the rest of its feature toolbox.

<br><br>
In support of both 2D and 3D design, AutoCAD features a range of commands that help with precision, such as centering lines and marks automatically calculated from your design size and placement, drawing dimensions that can be set to fixed proportions, and geometric arrays that help you more quickly replicate patterns.

<br><br>
For working in 3D, AutoCAD offers a variety of ways to view your design, so you can work on it at every angle. Whatever dimension you’re in, the software automatically saves useful design data for sharing and future reference. We’ll talk about specific features that are especially interesting in more detail later.

Install [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial)
<br>

[STEP 01] Go to https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/autocad on your Windows side, open a web browser (Chrome is recommended because the instructor tested).
<br>

[STEP 02] Click [CREATE ACCOUNT] if you do not have one. If you already have an Autodesk account, please sign in by clicking [SIGN IN](https://accounts.autodesk.com/Authentication/LogOn?viewmode=iframe&ReturnUrl=%2Fauthorize%3Fviewmode%3Diframe%26lang%3Den%26realm%3Ddownload-www.autodesk.com%26ctx%3Dadsk-download-www%26AuthKey%3Dfbdb35f8-2a05-4fa8-a190-5941bc22236d#username).
<br>

[STEP 03] Select an appropriate version of AutoCAD, for your system and language.
<br>

[STEP 04] Click [INSTALL](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial).
<br>

[STEP 05] Accept the license and services agreement.
<br>

[STEP 06] You will receive an email from Autodesk for the license information (Product key and Serial Number). It will be needed for the activation process.
<br>

[STEP 07] Click the downloaded installation file to install. The installation will take a while.
<br>

[STEP 08] After installation, the software will require activation. Please use the license information.
<br><h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">System Requirements </span></h1>
<br>
AutoCAD is generally compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems. Its core program can run on either operating system with no issues.
<br>However, when you get to the specialized tools, there are a couple of notable exceptions. If you need either of these features, make sure you’ll be able to use AutoCAD on a Windows machine:
<br><br>
Specialized toolsets:Unfortunately, the parts of AutoCAD that contain industry-specific drafting tools, like AutoCAD Mechanical 3D and AutoCAD Raster Design, are only compatible with Windows.
<br><br>
3D mapping: A more generalized feature that helps anyone who designs in 3D, 3D mapping helps you place objects in your designed world. It’s especially useful for those who use AutoCAD for interior design or other whole-space creations.

[200 AutoCAD Command and Shortcut list](https://www.thesourcecad.com/autocad-commands/)


<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">Features & Functions</span></h1>

2D Functions
<br>Text settings: Creates the text on your designs as a single or multi-line object so you can adjust the formatting all at once.
<br>Data extraction: Exports object metadata for use outside AutoCAD without needing a user to manually copy from the file. This ensures fast and accurate information transfers.
<br>Live data links: Creates a live link between data in an Excel spreadsheet and your AutoCAD file. Excellent for real-time calculations as projects change.
<br>Create your own parametric constraints: Maintains your design’s specific geometric parameters so you don’t have to worry about manually adhering to them as you’re working. It’s also good for keeping the proportions you want within your design.
<br>Centerlines and marks: Stays with each object as it moves so you’re always aware of its center no matter where it ends up on the design as a whole.
<br>Revision clouds: Lets you freehand (or use a shape outline) to highlight areas that you’d like to revise without becoming part of the design. This eliminates the need for you to remember to remove it or to go back and forth between old and new versions to make sure you caught the change.
<br>Arrays: Multiplies a selected object to create a repetitive pattern in a specified geometric pattern. Great for designs featuring evenly-spaced recurrences.

<br><br>3D Functions
<br>Solid, surface, and mesh modeling: Offers a variety of control over your 3D modeling so you can choose the process that best fits with your needs.
<br>Light and shading controls: Adjusts to show how your 3D object looks with types of light, illuminated at different angles, and with different strengths of shadows.
<br>Cloud rendering: Uses network capabilities to render your design without tying up your computer for the process.
<br>Model documentation: Like with 2D designs, offers thorough information about your 3D model to share, export, and update in real-time.
<br>Section planes: Creates planes that dissect your 3D object to show you its cross views at whatever angle you need.
<br>Point clouds: Lets you import data from 3D scanners to create your design from real-life objects (a bit like connect-the-dots).
