<!-- not problems just neeed to be updated/doing.md-->

1. We have updated everything accordingly with the last feedback

2. The Team members link and pictures have already been updated to the team webpage(button team members on the navbar), however updating members contents is done individually by each member (every member update their webpage themselves). (some member's profil have been deleted because their links have no content at all)

3. Languages: all the language buttons work well, however you will notice that in other languages (except the english), you will find somethings that are still written in english, this is because we are updating first the english language version and after we finish with the english version we will surely update the remaining two languages as their are supposed to be.
