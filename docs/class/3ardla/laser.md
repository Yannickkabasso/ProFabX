<h1 style="font-size:2vw"><span style="color:black">I. LASER CUTTING</span></h1>
<br>What is it? 
<br>Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut or engrave material based on computer-controlled parameters. The powerful and highly accurate laser focuses on a small area of the material. The laser can cut through different kinds of materials like: plastics, woods, rubbers, foams, papers, acrylics, fabrics and some even metal.

<br>There are several techniques that can be performed with a laser cutter.

<br>Laser marking: involves the melting of a surface layer of a material to leave a mark behind.
<br>Laser engraving: is similar to laser marking, with the difference being that the aim here is to create a deep engraved mark.
<br>Laser cutting: is a process where material is cut, and this can be for small and fine materials or materials with a much greater level of thickness.
<br>Laser drilling: involves the creation of popped holes or dents in a material, which is achieved by pulsing a laser beam on a particular area repeatedly.
<br>Laser welding: is the process of welding materials together, whether this is one piece or multiple pieces of similar or dissimilar materials.

<h1 style="font-size:2vw"><span style="color:black">II. SAFETY INSTRUCTION</span></h1>
<br>

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">1. Introduction</span></h1>
     Laser cutting devices are very versatile tools that can be used to cut or drill wood, plastics, and metals. These devices are often very economical, efficient and can easily be automated. Due to these features, these devices have found their way to campus and before purchasing or using this type of equipment, there are some things to consider.
<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">2. Laser Hazard Classification</span></h1>
Typically, LASER cutters are classified by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as Class 1 LASERs. Class 1 LASERs emit low levels of energy that are not hazardous to the eyes or skin. However, enclosed within these devices are often Class 3B or 4 LASERs, which are capable of emitting high levels of energy, and are hazardous to the eyes and skin. Only manufacturer-trained personnel should perform maintenance on the device.
<br> 

- DO NOT modify or disable any safety features of the laser system.
- DO NOT operate the laser unless all covers are in place and interlocks are working properly.
- DO NOT look directly into LASER beam.

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">3. Laser Generated Air Contaminants</span></h1>
While LASER cutters typically pose little hazard due to the Class 1 Enclosure, these devices can pose a hazard when the beam is used to cut or drill certain metals, plastics, and other materials. As the beam strikes these materials, there is potential to produce Laser-Generated Air Contaminants. These contaminants may be gaseous or particulate and can, under certain conditions, pose health risks to those exposed to them. The contaminant generated will depend on the type of material that is being cut or drilled. Cutting or drilling of some materials can generate airborne benzene, toluene, hydrochloric acid, isocyanates and other by-products which may be hazardous.

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">4. Filtration and Ventilation Requirements</span></h1>
To control the LASER-generated air contaminants, filtration and/or exhaust systems must be used to reduce or eliminate personnel exposures. In addition to reducing or eliminating personnel exposures, proper removal of contaminants is essential to ensure a properly functioning LASER cutter, as well as producing a quality product. The choice of whether to use filtration or exhaust systems will be specified by the manufacturer and these specifications should be followed. 

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">5. Laser safety</span></h1>
Most types of lasers operating in the visible and near infrared regions are sufficiently intense as to represent a hazard to the eye. Although damage may be caused to all parts of the eyes, the most vulnerable part is the retina, on which the beam may be focussed by the eye lens resulting in the destruction of tissues and the creation of permanent blind spots. High power lasers can also damage the skin. Only trained peaple can operate the machine, and we must close the enclosure before run the machine.

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">6. Laser classes</span></h1>
The current laser classes in national laser classes are: 1, 2, 3A, 3B and 4. The class of each laser must be marked clearly by the supplier.

Class 1:It is safe in the reasonable working condition, and no specific safety controls are required.
Class 2: Wavelength range from 400nm to 700nm, visible lasers
Class 3A: Lower risk than 3B, but direct viewing of beam usually safe
Class 3B: Intrabeam viewing not safe to the eye, diffusely reflected beam usually safe to the eye, assumed to be safe to the skin.
Class 4: Those that generate the hazardous diffusely reflected beam, which may be harmful to the eye or skin, and can present a fire hazard.
During normal operation, the machine is enclosed and laser classification is Class 1. In normal usage the interlocked machine does not allow exposure to any dangerous laser radiation. The cutting chamber is fully enclosed during standard operation and keys are needed to access all body panels that open. In school's safety rule,laser operator need wear normal PPE (Laboratory coat, Safety glasses, Dust mask).

- Paper
- Acrylic
- Wood
<h1 style="font-size:2vw"><span style="color:black">IV. MACHINE PREPARATION</span></h1>
Make sure to check all connections, this includes the power socket for the laser cutter, the smoke exhaust fan which should be open and running, the water tank, and the pump.
<h1 style="font-size:2vw"><span style="color:black">V. RUNNING THE MACHINE</span></h1>
Turn on the laser cutter. place the material flat on the platform. place a block between the nozzle and material. rise platform to min the gap. 
<h1 style="font-size:2vw"><span style="color:black">Power and Speed Demo</span></h1>
<br><div class="loader"><img src="images/laserdemo.webp" alt="#" /></div>
We create a demo which can check the best parameter. it is a 7 piece cutting demo with powers; 90,80,70,60,50,40,30 and a speed of 70mm/s.
The squares are drawn in fusion360 and imported into LaserCAD as a DXF file.
<br><div class="loader"><img src="images/laserdemo4.webp" alt="#" /></div>

-Step1: Material and Drawings
<br>

We first created all the components of the tree in [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial)
<br><div class="loader"><img src="images/laserdraw.jpg" alt="#" /></div>

- Step2:Next save all the components into your computer as DXF files
<br><div class="loader"><img src="images/laserdxf.jpg" alt="#" /></div>
<br>
<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:black">Model size</span>: All the dimensions are in mm
<br><div class="loader"><img src="images/treedimensions.jpg" alt="#" /></div>
<br>The tree is made with 3 mm lasered PLA and a length of aluminium tubing. All the parts fit into an A4-sheet of wood, and the whole thing is designed to be packed up into an A5 envelope.</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:black">Parts Instructions</span></h1>
<br><div class="loader"><img src="images/partsinstruction.jpg" alt="#" /></div>

What we've used for this small tree (+/- 13cm) is one sheet of 3mm MDF of 60x30 cm.

You can directly <a href="images/parts_to_laser.dxf" download="parts_to_laser.dxf">Download dxf file</a> here
- Step3:open the files in laser CAD, set the power and speed and download them into the laser cutter and cut.
<br><div class="loader"><img src="images/laserset.jpg" alt="#" /></div>
<div class="loader"><img src="images/laser.gif" alt="laser.gif"max-width="1000" height="500" />

- Step4:Finally get all the components and assemble them.
<br>Assembling the tree is quite easy. Start with the round base and add the two panels with the central piece. Then add the biggest leaves piece and add three bings rings. Add the slightly smaller leaves piece, three rings and repeat until four leaves pieces are stacked. Then add one big ring and two small ones. Add the remaining pieces like before.

At the top I added a smaller ring to make a nice finish. The star then fits inside the slot at the top. A drop of glue can help it to stay in place if needed.
